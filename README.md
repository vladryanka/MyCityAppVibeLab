Choose an app name based on the city you selected. Even though this project is called the My City app, you are encouraged to customize the app name to be specific to your city.

Create lists for different categories of recommendations for your city. For example, you can create a list of recommended:

Coffee shops
Restaurants
Kid-friendly places
Parks
Shopping centers
Your app should contain several lists of recommendations from different categories. Try to create at least 3 to 5 recommendations for each category so the screen doesn't look too empty.
